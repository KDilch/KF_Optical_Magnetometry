# KF_Optical_Magnetometry
This is a continuation of the kalman-filtering-for-atomic-sensors project. It contains the simulation of an atomic sensor, also in presence of correlations in measurement and intrinsic noise. It also implements the model that can be used to suboptimally estimate the magnetic field in a quantum sensor (using continuous quantum no-demolition measurement). There are a few versions of a Kalman Filter including Continuous-Continuous Extended Kalman Filter, Correlated Continuous-Continuous Extended Kalman Filter, Correlated Continuous-Continuous Extended Kalman Filter for a quantum model, Continuous-Discrete Extended Kalman Filter, Correlated Continuous-Discrete Extended Kalman Filter. The architecture of this application enables the user to run the simulations efficiently (parallelization) which is especially useful in a quantum case where we want to repeat the simulations many time to gather proper statistical sample. There are also additional features that can help with investigating the simulation stability as well as research different numerical methods.
